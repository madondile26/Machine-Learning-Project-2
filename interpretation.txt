Follow these steps:

● Run your kmeans.py file using 3 clusters on the 1953 and 2008 datasets
  separately. Document your observations in your text file. Take note of how
  the clusters change from 1953 to 2008. You will need to pay attention not
  only to which countries are in clusters together but also to the Life
  Expectancy and BirthRates for those clusters.

  1953 Dataset:

  Cluster 1: This cluster has a moderate number of countries (48-60) throughout the iterations.
             The mean Life Expectancy is around 41 years, and the mean Birth Rate is around 55-56
             per 1000 people. These countries seem to have moderate life expectancy and birth rates 
             compared to other clusters.

  Cluster 2: This cluster consistently contains around 48 countries in all iterations. The mean Life
             Expectancy is very low, around 22 years, while the mean Birth Rate is the highest among 
             all clusters, around 66 per 1000 people. These countries have significantly low life 
             expectancy and high birth rates, indicating poor health and social conditions.

  Cluster 3: Initially, this cluster has the highest number of countries (102), but the number decreases
             to 88-89 in later iterations. The mean Life Expectancy is around 47 years, and the mean Birth
             Rate is around 39-40 per 1000 people. These countries tend to have higher life expectancy and 
             lower birth rates compared to the other clusters.

  2008 Dataset:

  Cluster 1: Initially, this cluster contains the highest number of countries (95), but the number decreases
             to around 72-75 in later iterations. The mean Life Expectancy starts very low (around 18 years)
             but increases slightly over iterations, reaching around 22 years. The mean Birth Rate is the 
             highest among all clusters, starting at around 72 and decreasing slightly over iterations. These 
             countries have extremely low life expectancy and very high birth rates, indicating regions facing
             severe health and socio-economic challenges, similar to Cluster 2 in the 1953 dataset.

  Cluster 2: This cluster consistently contains around 47 countries in all iterations. The mean Life Expectancy
             is relatively high, starting at around 37 years and remaining stable over iterations. The mean Birth
             Rate is moderate, starting at around 54-55 per 1000 people and showing slight fluctuations but 
             remaining relatively stable. These countries seem to have moderate life expectancy and birth rates,
             similar to Cluster 1 in the 1953 dataset.

  Cluster 3: Initially, this cluster has the lowest number of countries (46), but the number increases to around 
             77 in later iterations. The mean Life Expectancy starts very low (around 13 years) and increases 
             slightly over iterations, reaching around 12 years. The mean Birth Rate starts very high (around 79) 
             and decreases slightly over iterations, remaining above 76. These countries initially have extremely 
             low life expectancy and very high birth rates, similar to Cluster 2 in the 1953 dataset.

● Next, run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv. Note any
  observations in your text file. Which countries are moving up clusters?
  How does the data from 2008 compare to the data from 1953? Are there
  any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953
  countries? Try and explain why. Are there any 1953 countries that are in a
  cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? Try and explain why in
  your text file.

  1. Cluster Characteristics:

     - Cluster 1: Countries with the lowest life expectancy and highest birth rates.
     - Cluster 2: Nations with relatively higher life expectancy but still exhibiting high birth rates.
     - Cluster 3: Countries with moderate life expectancy and birth rates.
     - Cluster 4: Nations with the highest life expectancy and relatively lower birth rates.

  2. Changes Across Iterations:

     - Mean life expectancy and birth rates stabilize across iterations, indicating convergence.
     - The number of countries in each cluster may fluctuate slightly but generally remains consistent.

  3. Comparison with 1953 and 2008:
     - The clusters show a wider range of demographic indicators due to combined data from both years.
     - Cluster composition resembles characteristics from both 1953 and 2008 datasets, reflecting changes over time.

  4. Observations on Country Movement:

     - Some countries may transition between clusters across iterations, reflecting demographic changes.
     - Analyzing country movements can provide insights into evolving socio-economic factors.

  5. Explanation for Cluster Composition:

     - Factors such as economic development, healthcare access, and cultural norms influence cluster composition.
     - Similar socio-economic profiles lead countries to cluster together based on shared characteristics.
